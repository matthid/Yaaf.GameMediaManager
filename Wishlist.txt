Wish List (Future Versions)
|Features:
 - Allow Custom Actions to be setup via GUI

 - Info Extraction from mediadata (players,mapname,server, ...) as plugin system
 -> Example Plugin for sc2 replays.
 -> Start new sessions when something differs to hard (like playerlist).
 - Manually extract Mediafiles into new session (open a secound Match-End Window)
 - Automatic Updates 
 (note: not any database update is supported. For example it is possible that you have to update to version 1.9 first before you can update to 2.0. Updatecode should consider such requirements)
 - GUI Redesign (nicer look&feel and more intuitive)
 - More user input validation (currently it will just fail when inserting to database)
